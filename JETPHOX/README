NLO predictions are obtained with the newest version of JETPHOX which is 1.3.1.4.
The centre-of-mass energy is given in the respective fill name.

Cross section: dSigma/dpt dy (nb/GeV)
histogram to use for comparison to data: _TOTAL_scl_10_10_10
proton PDF: NNPDF40
nuclear PDF for Pb in p-Pb: nNNPDF30
NLO: yes
isolation: 2.0GeV in R=0.4 (charged+neutral). This shoud roughly correspond to 1.5GeV charged only
photon rapidity: -0.8<y<0.8 (but xsection is normalized by dy)
events: 5mio per pt hard bin (12 pt hard bins)
fragmentation: BFG set II
IS factorization scale: 1 * photon pt
renormalisation scale: 1 * photon pt 
FS factorisation scale: 1 * photon pt

Scale variations:
scl_05_05_05 = all three mentioned scale varied to 0.5 * photon pt
scl_20_20_20 = all three mentioned scale varied to 2.0 * photon pt
